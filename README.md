<p align="center">The crucial issue of mental health, particularly among students, motivated our team. We also observed a dearth of knowledge about mental health in tier 2 and tier cities. We made a platform enabling people to communicate about their mental health without being concerned about disclosing their identities as a result. </p>

## 📑 What it does 
- The platform can provide a secure and transparent environment for individuals to share their experiences, seek support, and access resources related to mental health.
- Blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature can ensure that sensitive information related to mental health is protected and not susceptible to hacking or other security breaches.
- The users can share their experiences, tips, quotes etc. regarding mental health by posting on the platform.
- The users can also tip the posts of other users as well as their own posts.

## 🏗 How we built it 
- Firstly, we set up a blockchain (local using Ganache).
- Next, we developed smart contracts for the posts.
- Finally, we created the client side website so that anyone can use our app and post their experiences.
